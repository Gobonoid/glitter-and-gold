#### Assumptions made
* There are no duplicates in the CSV
* All transactions in the CSV are valid
* Emails are unique and can be used as a single user wallet identifier
* No two emails can share same wallet
* It's not performance critical application and certain overhead can be added for simplified solution
* No realtime processing of CSV and top 3 spenders is wanted hence simplified solution
